How should this inform the next budget cycle?", options: ["Increase the allocation for that vote to encourage spending", "Maintain the same allocation for consistency", "Reduce the allocation and reallocate the funds to votes with proven need", "Ignore the trend as it is not important"], answer: "c"},
